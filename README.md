# Custom Modal Dialog

A "Custom Modal Dialog" is a user interface element designed and implemented by the developer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It appears as a pop-up window that blocks interactions with the underlying web page until closed, making it ideal for user feedback, input, or important messages. 
This customization allows seamless integration with the website's design and user experience.
